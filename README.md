# electron-sim

It took some dirty hacks to make this stable. Velocity is capped and charges don't interact if they're too close to each other. This was acceptable for my purposed because I really just wanted to see emergent behaviour like attraction to electrically neutral conductors by polarization and charge accumulating on the surface/edge of a conductor.
